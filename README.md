# Smart Contract Development Using Solidity

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing the smart contract.
- **Remix IDE**: For writing, compiling, and deploying the contract.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Platform for executing and storing transactions.
- **Libraries**:
  - **web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
  - **ethers.js**: Lightweight library for Ethereum-based scripting.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and upload the Solidity files from the repository.

3. Compile the contract:
   - Use Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0`.

4. Deploy the contract:
   - Deploy to a testnet (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) or the Ethereum mainnet.

5. Interact with the contract:
   - Use Remix or integrate with frontend libraries like Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the campaign target amount and deadline during contract deployment.

2. **Making Contributions**:
   - Users call the `contribute()` function and send Ether to the contract.

3. **Withdrawing Funds**:
   - Owners call `withdrawFunds()` to access funds if the target is met after the deadline.

4. **Issuing Refunds**:
   - Contributors call `issueRefund()` to get their funds back if the target isn't reached.
